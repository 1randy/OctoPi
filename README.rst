OctoPi
======
A `Raspberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ distribution for 3d printers. It includes the `Octoprint <http://octoprint.org>`_
,  3d printer out of the box, and `mjpg-streamer <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpg-streamer/>`_ for live viewing of prints and stop motion video creation.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. `qemu-arm-static <http://packages.debian.org/sid/qemu-user-static>`_
#. Downloaded `Raspbian <http://www.raspbian.org/>`_ image.
#. root privileges for choot
#. Bash

Build OctoPi From within OctoPi / Raspbian / Debian / Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OctoPi can be built from Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, or even OctoPi.
Build requires about 2.5 GB of free space avilable.
You can build it by issuing the following commands::

    sudo apt-get install realpath qemu-user-static
    git clone https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi.git
    cd OctoPi/src
    wget http://files.velocix.com/c1410/images/raspbian/2013-07-26-wheezy-raspbian/2013-07-26-wheezy-raspbian.zip
    sudo bash -x ./build

Usage
~~~~~

#. In the ``src/config`` script set the path of ``ZIP_IMG`` to the path of your Raspbian image.
#. Run ``src/build`` as root.
#. The final image will be created at the ``src/workspace``



Code contribution would be appreciated!
