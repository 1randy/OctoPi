            <h1>What is OctoPi?</h1>

            <p>
                OctoPi is a Raspberry Pi distribution for 3d printers. It includes the OctoPrint host
                software for 3d printers out of the box and mjpg-streamer with RaspiCam support
                for live viewing of prints and timelapse video creation. OctoPi also includes
                OctoPiPanel, which is an LCD display app that works with OctoPrint, and scripts
                to configure supported displays.
            </p>

                <li>
                    Unzip the zipped image and install the contained <code>.img</code> file to an sd card
                    <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md">like any other Raspberry Pi image</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Configure your WiFi by editing <code>octopi-network.txt</code>
                    on the root of the flashed card when using it like a thumb drive
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boot the Pi from the card
                </li>
                <li>
                    Log into your Pi via SSH (it is located at <code>octopi.local</code>

                    or the IP address assigned by your router), default username
                    is "pi", default password is "raspberry", change the
                    password using the <code>passwd</code> command and expand
                    the filesystem of the SD card through the corresponding
                    option when running <code>sudo raspi-config</code>.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                OctoPrint is located at <a href="http://octopi.local">http://octopi.local</a>
                and also at <a href="https://octopi.local">https://octopi.local</a>.
                Since the SSL certificate is self signed (and generated upon first boot),
                you will get a certificate warning at the latter location, please ignore it.
            </p>

            <p>
                If a USB webcam or the Raspberry Pi camera is detected, MJPG-streamer
                will be started automatically as webcam server. OctoPrint on
                OctoPi ships with correctly configured stream and snapshot URLs
                pointing at it. If necessary, you can reach it under
                <code>http://octopi.local/webcam/?action=stream</code> and SSL
                respectively, or directly on its configured port 8080:
                <code>http://octopi.local:8080/?action=stream</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                CuraEngine 15.04 is installed and OctoPrint ships pre-configured with
                the correct path to utilize it for on-board-slicing. Just import
                a Cura Slicing Profile in OctoPrint's settings and start slicing
                directly on your Pi.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yes!
